# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis on Kickstarter data to discover trends.

## Discription
A kickstarter dataset was given in order to determine which type of kickstarter (Parent and Sub- Category) to begin, when & where to begin the campaign.

### 1.Determining Parent Category 
In the chart below, we have the following parent categories for kickerstarts: _film & video, food, games, journailzm, music, photography, publishing, technology, & theater_. By comparison, theater seems to have the most attempts from all the other parent categories. So we have determined '_Theater_' as our Parent Category for which type of kickstarter campaign to begin.

### 2.Determining Subcategory
Now that Theater has been determined for the parent category as '_Theater_', now it is time to determine the subcategory. Based on the data, there are three subcategories for ‘_Theater_’: _Plays, Musical, & Spaces_. Upon further analysis of the subcategories, ‘Plays’ is the most attempted subcategory with the highest success rate compared to the other two subcategories, as seen in the chart below:

### 3.Determining When to Begin Kickstarter 
Now that _Theater: Plays_ have been determined to be the Parent and sub-category for the kickstarter, the month of commencment must be chosen. The data set has the date of the kcikstarter commencment and we know wheather that kickstarter was seccussful, failed or canclled. Taking this into account, a timeline was created (see below). Each line represents either successful, failed, cancelled or live kick-starters, depending on the month they were initialized.

Based on the chart above, May is the chosen month to initiate the _Theater-Play_. There are many more successful _Theater:Plays_ initiated in this particual month than any other.

### 4.Where to Begin the Kickstarter 
The only other counrty to have a similar intrest in theater-plays is Great Britain (GB). The US has more than double the number of attempts for Theater-plays kickstarters (US: 671; UK:314), the success rate in GB is 14% more than in US (US: 61%; UK: 75%) as seen in the chart below:

  However, the US has much more intrest in _Theater: Plays_ than GB, and according to the chart below, US's height of intrest is much more intense for longer periods of time, where as GB intrest hikes around the same time as the US's, but dramatically drops after two months.

  Take a look as well as the amount of money actually recieved and pleadged by country and kickstarter. Based on the chart below, the average goal amount for US on _Theater:Plays_ is just above $7.1:, whicle in the GB the average goal amount is $2.6K. GB's QLR is between $.7K and $3K while US's is  between 1K-7K, which is quite a difference! There is much more optomism to gain much more contributions in the US than in GB.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis conducted, begining a _**Theater: Play**_ kickstarter in the month of May in the US would be the best option as data trends indicate that these factors suggest most of the successful campaigns include the factors mantioned above.
